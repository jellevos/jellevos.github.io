  abstract  = {In their pursuit to maximize their return on in-
vestment, cybercriminals will likely reuse as much as possible
between their campaigns. Not only will the same phishing
mail be sent to tens of thousands of targets, but reuse of
the tools and infrastructure across attempts will lower their
costs of doing business. This reuse, however, creates an effective
angle for mitigation, as defenders can recognize domain names,
attachments, tools, or systems used in a previous compromisation
attempt, significantly increasing the cost to the adversary as it
would become necessary to recreate the attack infrastructure
each time.
However, generating such cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is
resource-intensive, so organizations often turn to CTI providers
that commercially sell feeds with such indicators. As providers
have different sources and methods to obtain their data, the
coverage and relevance of feeds will vary for each of them. To
cover the multitude of threats one organization faces, they are
best served by obtaining feeds from multiple providers. However,
these feeds may overlap, causing an organization to pay for
indicators they already obtained through another provider.
This paper presents a privacy-preserving protocol that allows
an organization to query the databases of multiple data providers
to obtain an estimate of their total coverage without revealing
the data they store. In this way, a customer can make a
more informed decision on their choice of CTI providers. We
implement this protocol in Rust to validate its performance
experimentally: When performed between three CTI providers
who collectively have 20,000 unique indicators, our protocol takes
less than 6 seconds to execute. The code for our experiments is
freely available.},
