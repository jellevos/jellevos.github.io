My research focuses on secure **Multi-Party Computation** (MPC) protocols using **homomorphic encryption**. I am specifically interested in **lattice-based cryptography**. I aim to apply these techniques to **cyber threat intelligence**, where classical solutions fall short due to the sensitive nature of data.
