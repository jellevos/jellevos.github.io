My research focuses on **secure computation** protocols using **homomorphic encryption**, and I am specifically interested in **lattice-based cryptography**. My main topics of research include *secure computation compilers*, *private set operations*, and *post-quantum cryptography*.

I am currently working in the [cyber security group](https://www.tudelft.nl/cybersecurity/) of Delft University of Technology in the faculty of [EEMCS](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/) and as a remote contractor for Apple, where I work on post-quantum cryptography.

```
I am on the lookout for postdoc opportunities or exciting research/engineering positions in industry!
I will finish my PhD at the end of June 2025.
