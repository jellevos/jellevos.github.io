My research focused on **secure computation** protocols using **homomorphic encryption**, and I take specific interest in **lattice-based cryptography**. My main topics of research include *secure computation compilers*, *private set operations*, and *post-quantum cryptography*.

During my PhD I also worked for Apple (part-time), where I designed [the first practical hybrid password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1343) called CPaceOQUAKE. The specification can be found in [this IETF draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-vos-cfrg-pqpake-00.html).
